# Message

There are four kinds of Messages.

- `SystemMessage`: provides key instructions to which models should adhere.
- `UserMessage`: non-model-generated messages (such as prompts, documents and
  user input).
- `AssistantMessage`: generated by the assistant in response to previous
  messages.
- `ToolMessage`: generated within a tool-calling loop.

Messages are actions. We can yield them from within Liminal generators in order
to append them to scope's underlying the message list.

```ts
function* G() {
  yield* system`...`
  yield* user`...`
}
```

> Note: this example does not showcase the creation of `AssistantMessage` nor
> `ToolMessage`, as these should never be explicitly yielded outside a
> `RunInfer` implementation.
