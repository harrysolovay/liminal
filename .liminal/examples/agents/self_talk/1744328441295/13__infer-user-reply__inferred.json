The concept of job polarization is indeed concerning, especially as it highlights the potential widening gap between different skill levels in the workforce. It raises important questions about how we can effectively prepare workers for the future job market. I'm particularly interested in discussing potential solutions, such as reskilling and upskilling initiatives, and how educational systems can adapt to these changes. What are your thoughts on the best approaches to address these challenges?"
