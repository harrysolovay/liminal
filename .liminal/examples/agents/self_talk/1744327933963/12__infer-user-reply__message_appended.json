It's concerning to think about the potential displacement of middle-skill jobs, but I appreciate the emphasis on reskilling and upskilling as a way to prepare for the future. It seems crucial for both individuals and organizations to adapt to these changes to ensure a more equitable job market. I'm curious about what specific strategies or programs are being implemented to facilitate this transition."
