    "content": "Thank you for the insightful explanation! The concept of job polarization is indeed concerning, especially as it highlights the potential for increased economic inequality. It raises important questions about how we can effectively prepare the workforce for the future. I agree that education and retraining programs will be crucial in helping workers transition into high-skill roles.
