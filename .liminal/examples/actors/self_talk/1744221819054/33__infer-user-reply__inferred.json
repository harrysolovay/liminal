The initiatives in the technology, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and finance sectors highlight the importance of adaptability and continuous learning. I'm particularly interested in how these reskilling efforts can be scaled and made accessible to a broader audience, especially for those in middle-skill jobs who may be most affected by automation. What are some strategies that could be implemented to ensure that reskilling opportunities are available to everyone?"
