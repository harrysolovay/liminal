The concept of augmented intelligence is indeed fascinating, as it highlights the potential for collaboration between humans and AI rather than a straightforward replacement of jobs. It’s encouraging to think about how this could lead to new roles and opportunities that leverage our unique human skills. I’m particularly interested in how we can prepare the workforce for these changes and what specific skills will be most valuable in the future."
